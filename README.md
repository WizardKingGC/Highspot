For this take home, I did it as simply as possible. 

✓ Are all requirements met? 
Yes, it provides the 3 functions asks in this project
✓ Does the application run successfully on a Mac or Linux? 
It should be able to run on both, although havent tested in Linux
✓ Does your README explain how to run your application?
Yes, will include down below
✓ Have you provided justification(s) in your scaling discussion?
In terms of scaling. I hashed a lot of the json data, so memory could be a issue, but it is time efficient. Also I tried to not keep it simple by not building out many objects as I thought they were not needed in this project.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Running the Project. 

All you have to do is use any IDE that is compatible with Python3, and run 'python3 main.py' on the cmd/terminal. I thought this was the simpliest way to complete the project. ALso did not make any folders to keep the pathing simple.  After you run the command line the output.json will be populated with the changes that we wanted in the changes.jsonfile.  

Incase the output does not populate for you, I added a print of the json object in the main, it is commented out on line 75(bottom of the py file).

Note: personally I used vscode and the python extension
